RECAP
Warning - One option - Okay

Confirmation - Two options - Okay and Cancel

Prompt - We have input bar where we can prompt any text we want, and can click Okay or Cancel


How do we handle alerts in Cypress?
    Cypress by default handles the warning and confirmation alerts by clicking the Okay. Cypress does not handle the prompt alert because
    it assumes input must be entered by the uer.

    We dont handle the warning and confirmation alerts, but if we want to interact with there dialogs, we have to use cy.on event listener.

    Cy.on() => It's an event listener that listens specific events that are triggered by the browser, and handles it if its needed.

    cy.on('window:alert)
    cy.on('window:confirm)

    How to handle Prompt in Cypress? 

        First, we have to call the prompt method, whicxh is an instance of a windows object in Javascript. After, we need to use 
        cy.stub() which is a method that is coming from the Sinon bundled library which will allow us to replace the functionality of the
        original prompt method.

        cy.window().then((win) => {
            cy.stub(win, 'prompt').returns('some input')
        })

    
    
    Keyboard and Mouse Actions in Cypress

        Cypress Keyboard or Mouse actions are simulated which are actually fired from the JS. For this reason while using any cypress UI 
        interaction methods. We might end up having errors.

        To fix this issue, it's suggested to install a library called "real-events" from npm. This library creates user actions using
        Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) which is pretty much same as real user actions.
